# Data Cleaning
This repository consists of a number of data sets that have been cleaned by me. All of it is done in Python!

About the word document:-
- It contains a list of all the commands that I have used in order to clean the data sets. 
- It is not meant to be studied from as it is not organised well enough (on purpose).
- The basis of that document is to find previously used commands very easily (CTRL + F) in case we need it for tackling new data sets.

Go through my work and reach out me if you want to talk about it. 
I would be happy to help in any way that I can.
